&lt;p&gt;In Competitive Programming, competitors are given a set of programming
problems to solve within a given time period. The competitor who solved
the most number of problems or has accumulated the highest score is
declared as the winner. Just like in sports or games, competitors need to
train and practice in order to win. The types of programming problems usually involve
data structures and algorithms as well as math concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First learn the basics of programming and the features of the programming language you want to use.
After taking CMSC 12, CMSC 21, and CMSC 22, you should have
a good understanding of variables, data types, recursion, operators, I/O facilities, control flow, arrays and strings, searching, sorting, etc. of Python3, C, and Java.
You should be able to translate basic algorithms into working and correct code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, learn some Discrete Mathematics. You can get this from CMSC 56 and CMSC 57. These courses do not require coding and mostly use pen and paper.
However, I recommend that you attempt to implement the algorithms studied in these courses. Understand set theory, counting techniques,
methods of proofs, trees, graphs, some automata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, learn some Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis. You can get this from CMSC 123. Master linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs, etc. You will also be introduced to algorithm analysis to determine the performance of algorithms. Knowing this is important because some
problems will required solutions that have bounds in terms of time and memory. Using more efficient (in terms of time and storage) data structures and algorithms might be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, practice solving problems in online platforms. I recommend &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://open.kattis.com/universities/uplb.edu.ph"&gt;Kattis&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. Most problem statements have some &amp;quot;story&amp;quot;. &lt;em&gt;A good skill to develop is how to extract the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; problem hidden in the story&lt;/em&gt;. Always solve first
with pen and paper before writing code. Also, make sure to consider &amp;quot;edge cases&amp;quot; in your solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab exercises in the courses mentioned above are relatively easy compared to the problems in competitive programming. You might be overwhelmed while starting out but don't give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Code Quality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad to say, but code for competitive programming does not need to be readable and maintainale in the traditional sense of software engineering.
To solve problems, your program reads an input file(or from stdin) and then write an to an output file(or to stdout). The code with the minimum lines of code that solves a problem correctly is the ideal. Forget using human-readable variable names. Use the C preprocessor to create shorthands for loops etc. Sometimes you don't need to implement data structures from scratch, use the built-in libraries in the language. Use STL in C++.
I recommend learning C++ for competitive programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing CMSC 123 and practicing regularly (1 to 2 hours a day), you can actually make progress on your own. Study more advanced topics and solve more difficult problems. Test your skills in actual competitions.&lt;/p&gt;
